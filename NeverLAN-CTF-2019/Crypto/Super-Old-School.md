These are babylonian numbers and can be found with a quick google search.  A “<” symobl is 10, and one pin looking symbol is a “1”.  When you convert them to the appropriate numbers and map it to the alphabet where A = 1, you get the flag.

25 15 21 18 - 6 12 1 7 - 9 19 - 19 15 - 13 1 14 25 - 3 18 25 16 22 15 19, which translates to….
