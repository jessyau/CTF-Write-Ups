# Problem
“REPORT: 'My Customer forgot his Password. His Fname is Jimmy. Can you get his password for me? It should be in the users table'”

Note: There is a webpage with an input box and a submit button, that’s all.

## Process
This is a simple SQL select statement based on knowledge.  They’re just looking for the proper command, which is: SELECT * FROM users WHERE fname='Jimmy'

## Flag
flag{SQL_F0r_Th3_W1n}
