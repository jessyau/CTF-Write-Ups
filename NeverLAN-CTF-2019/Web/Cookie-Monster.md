# Problem
Leads to a web page.

## Process

When you start digging/inspecting on the website, you find that it loads a cookie with cookie name “Red_Guy’s_Name” and value “NameGoesHere”.  Page has text “He’s my favorite Red guy”

This is an odd one, but if you change the "NameGoesHere" to "Elmo" and refresh the page, you are greeted with the flag.
