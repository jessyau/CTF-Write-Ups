# Problem
In 2018 NeverlanCTF was one of the Keynotes for a security conference.

There is a video of it on youtube.

I remember seeing a flag. This one is not as easy as you think.

## Process
This one is in fact.. as easy as you may think :P

Some googling will show that NeverLAN crew spoke at SaintCon in 2018.  Upon searching the name of their speech, we can find the [keynote video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wthauUWsGI) from the conference. Around the 1:50 mark is where we see the flag presented.

## Flag
