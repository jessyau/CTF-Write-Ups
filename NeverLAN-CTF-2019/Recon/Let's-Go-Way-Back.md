# Problem
Back in the day, Zesty hid a flag in the first version of our website.

## Process
The name of the challenge is a hint - so we use the WayBackMachine to view the history of the neverlanctf.com website.  I dug through source code, tried to find tiny artifacts - nothing.  Then I noticed that the background image of the matrix code is static, so I downloaded the image to see if anything stood out. Lo and behold, thereâ€™s a string that is a different color and stands out.
